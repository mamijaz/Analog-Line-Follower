# Analog Line Follower

The Project is to dessign an analog line follower, This implimentaion of the analog line follower uses the state machine concept to realize the design.

The design uses 6 digital line hunting sensors arange in an array of 2 lines with 3 sensors in each. All the posible movement stages and power stages were analysed and simplifed to a boolean algebra. The boolean algebra was then realised with digital boolean IC's for controle and soft switches for deliver the power level signals. The power controle uses PWM concepts and uses opamps in deferent configuration to achive that. There is 3 power levels alocated for each state of motion which could be adjest by using the dedicated potentiometer for each state.
